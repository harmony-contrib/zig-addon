# zig-addon

This project can help us to build a native module library for OpenHarmony/HarmonyNext with zig-lang.

> Note: This project is still in the early stage of development and is not ready for use. You can use it as a toy.

## Example

We provide a simple example to help you get started in `examples/add`.

Just run the following command to build the example:

```bash
zig build
```

And you can get `libadd.so` in `zig-out/dist`.
